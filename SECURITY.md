# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities should **not** be reported as an issue on GitHub because anyone can see this issue and use it.

On the other hand, Security vulnerabilities should be reported **as fast as possible**.

Instead, they should be reported via the `Report a vulnerability` option on GitHub, on Keybase (to user [`dan1st`](https://keybase.io/dan1st)) or on Discord (user [`dan1st#7327`](https://discord.com/users/358291050957111296)).

Private Messages on Discord are only allowed if the both users are member of a common server (Guild).
In order to bypass that, you can join [this Server](https://discord.gg/sSTCSfP).
